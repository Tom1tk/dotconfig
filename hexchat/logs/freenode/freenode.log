May 02 20:26:46 *	- Thousand Leagues Under the Sea, A Journey to the Center of the
May 02 20:26:46 *	- Earth, and Around the World in Eighty Days. Often lauded as the

May 02 20:26:46 *	- space travel, skyscrapers, and worldwide communications
May 02 20:26:46 *	- networks long before these ideas became popularised or realised.
