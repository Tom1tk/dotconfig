May 02 20:35:57 <akik>	ses1984: i set the dpi using xrandr --dpi in the xorg initialization files
May 02 20:36:03 <ses1984>	xrandr gives
May 02 20:36:10 <ses1984>	can't open disply

May 02 20:36:29 <akik>	ses1984: open a new terminal
May 02 20:36:41 <ses1984>	that's what i get in a new termina;
May 02 20:36:59 <akik>	ses1984: ok you've changed something
May 02 20:37:26 <ses1984>	maybe? i inherited this system
May 02 20:38:13 <akik>	echo $DISPLAY should say something like :0
May 02 20:38:26 <akik>	xauth list should list the xorg authentication cookies
May 02 20:38:55 <ses1984>	it's empty but i get the same result when i set DISPLAY=:0
May 02 20:39:05 <akik>	it shouldn't be empty
May 02 20:39:05 <ses1984>	meaning xrandr still says can't open display
May 02 20:39:17 <akik>	and you don't need to set DISPLAY
May 02 20:39:22 <akik>	it should be automatic
May 02 20:39:39 <akik>	i think you should create a new user
